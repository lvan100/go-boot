# go-boot

[中文](README_CN.md)

For backend applications, startup and shutdown often involve routine processes. `go-boot` encapsulates these standardized workflows to streamline development and ensure consistency.

## Application Startup Workflow

### 1. Environment Preparation
System Check: Ensure system resources, ports, file permissions, and other dependencies are available and ready.  
Dependency Verification: Validate that required environment variables (e.g., JAVA_HOME, PYTHONPATH) and external dependencies are correctly configured.  
Resource Initialization: Load SSL certificates, encryption keys, or other essential external files.

### 2. Configuration Initialization
Configuration Loading: Support multiple sources such as configuration files, environment variables, and remote configuration centers.  
Environment-Specific Parsing: Load configurations tailored to the running environment (e.g., development, testing, production).  
Dynamic Updates: Enable hot-reload functionality by starting configuration watchers if needed.

### 3. Logging Initialization
Logger Setup: Configure log formats (e.g., JSON), log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR), and log rotation rules (e.g., daily, file size-based).  
Log Targets: Support multiple output destinations such as console, files, or remote log aggregation services.  
Contextual Information: Set global context details like service name, version, and instance ID.

### 4. Client Initialization
Database Connections: Initialize connection pools and perform health checks to ensure readiness.  
Cache Clients: Set up and warm up caching systems like Redis or Memcached.  
Message Queues: Start producers for Kafka, RabbitMQ, or other messaging systems.  
External API Clients: Initialize clients for external services (e.g., HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL) and perform connectivity tests.

### 5. Background Task Initialization
Task Scheduler: Start schedulers for periodic tasks using Quartz, cron expressions, or equivalent mechanisms.  
Async Task Pools: Configure thread pools with optimal resource allocation (core threads, max threads, queue capacities).  
Task Preloading: Load task states or prefetch dependencies to ensure readiness.

### 6. Server Initialization
Server Configuration: Load server settings, such as IP addresses, ports, and protocol types.  
Route Registration: Define API routes or service methods for REST, gRPC, WebSocket, etc.  
Service Registration: Register with service discovery platforms like Eureka, Consul, or Nacos.

### 7. Final Checks
Dependency Health: Confirm all dependent services are functioning as expected.  
Self-Health Checks: Trigger internal diagnostics to verify service readiness.  
Logging: Record startup completion time and application version for auditing purposes.

## Application Shutdown Workflow

### 1. Signal Capture
Signal Handling: Support various termination signals (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT) and bind appropriate handlers.  
Graceful Timeout: Define a timeout for graceful shutdown to prevent the system from being flagged as unresponsive.

### 2. Server Shutdown
Stop New Requests: Close listening ports to reject new connections.  
Complete Ongoing Requests: Allow ongoing requests to complete, with a timeout to enforce closure.  
Deregister Service: Remove the instance from service registries to avoid routing traffic to a stopped server.

### 3. Background Task Termination
Graceful Task Completion: Signal running tasks to finish their current cycles.  
Forced Termination: Use interruption mechanisms for tasks exceeding the timeout.  
State Persistence: Save task states and results to ensure proper recovery on restart.

### 4. Client Shutdown
Database Connections: Close connection pools, release resources, and disconnect from the database.  
Cache Clients: Disconnect from caching services and finalize pending operations.  
Message Queue Clients: Close producers and ensure no message loss during shutdown.  
External API Clients: Terminate long-lived connections (e.g., WebSocket) to external services.

### 5. Logging Shutdown
Flush Buffers: Ensure all log data in memory is written to the appropriate destination.  
Resource Cleanup: Release file handles, network connections, and other resources.

### 6. Configuration and Resource Cleanup
Memory Cleanup: Free global or thread-local variables to prevent memory leaks.  
File Cleanup: Remove temporary files or intermediate artifacts created during runtime.  
Lock Cleanup: Clear distributed or local locks to avoid conflicts during the next startup.

### 7. Exit Logging and Notifications
Exit Logs: Record the exit time, runtime duration, and any error details.  
Alerts: Notify on-call engineers or alerting systems if the shutdown is abnormal.

By standardizing these workflows, `go-boot` ensures robust startup and shutdown processes for backend applications.
